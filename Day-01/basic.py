# ************* PRINT() *************
# print is built in function used to ouput something on ouput screen
# down here we've printed an string, because of that we need to enclose it within quotes, they can be within single/double quotes (' / ")
print("Hello World")      # Hello World

# NOTE : on missing or unmatched quotes, interpreter will throw SYNTAX error



# ************* STATEMENTS *************
# Any python code which python interpreters executes is called statement
print("LMAO")



# ************* EXPRESSIONS *************
# expression are like the combination of variables, operations etc which gives some result
print(6+4)



# ************* COMMENTS *************
# Comments are basically way to describe what the code does
# comments are ignored by python interpreter
# In python a single line comment can be created by [#] symbol and ends at the end of line, just like this line
# Python don't actually have any multi-line comment, but there is catch, we can use multi-line strings as multi-line comments
# As long as string is not accessed by some variable we can use it as comment
# A multi-line comment starts with triple(' / ") and ends with triple(' / "). Use same type of quotes on both sides
