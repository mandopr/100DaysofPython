    Types of comparison operators

    >       ->      greater than
    <       ->      less than
    >=      ->      greater than or equals to
    <=      ->      less than or equals to
    ==      ->      equals to (NOTE : == is not same as = , cause = will assign values not compare)
    !=      ->      not equals to
