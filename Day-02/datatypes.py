# Data types are actually what they sounds, its the type of data
# Python has 3 primitive data types : 


# 1. String -> collection of characters stored within quotes(single/double) are string
# we've already done string in its seperate file


# 2: Number -> Number are just literal number in python, there are even sub types of number in python
    # i.  Integer -> Number which are whole numbers like 4, 7, 99
    # ii. Float -> Numbers with decimal point in them like 3.14, 6.5
print(7)            # 7
print(3.14)         # 3.14



# 3 : Boolean -> boolean data type have only two values. i) True ii) False
print(True)         # True
print(False)        # False




# ************* TYPE() *************

# type() function is used to see which type of datatype does variable holds.
print(type(7))      # <class 'int'>
print(type(3.14))   # <class 'float'>
print(type("7"))    # <class 'str'>
print(type(True))   # <class 'bool'>
